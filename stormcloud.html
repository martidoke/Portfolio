      <div class="problem">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Given that the cloud storage application market is growing so quickly, it can be difficult finding a niche that doesn’t contain too many competitors. The client only required their application be one that fit into the market but had very
          little direction as to what that would look like. Through research and trend analysis, I was able to find my project’s sweet spot.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>With a rapidly growing focus on international business and connectivity is it really all that surprising that storage cloud applications are on the rise? Globally integrated networks are enabling new, highly complex business models and
            StormCloud is here to support that growth in a niche specific way. With features dedicated to whiteboard and pinboard collaboration, you can be on the go while also still being in the loop.</p>

          <section class="topic">
            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>Considering there was no specific niche focused on in the project brief, I relied heavily on user research and competitive analysis to see where I could make a mark. Through a quick SWOT analysis, it became clear to
              me that the <mark>corporate sector is in a constant need for the best and most optimized applications.</mark> So, I dug a bit deeper to see what that would look like.</p>

            <h4>Survey</h4>
            <p>My next step was to create a <a href="https://forms.gle/8xK8zxegjVJGTws18" target="_blank" class="case-study-link">user survey</a> to learn, among other things, the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- How often they use cloud storage applications.</li>
              <li>- Which cloud storage application users use most frequently.</li>
              <li>- Their primary purpose for using these applications.</li>
              <li>- Common frustrations and favorites.</li>
              <li>- Which features were most utilized.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The survey was distributed across networking applications & online forums and concluded with <mark>25 respondents</mark>. My main takeaways from the responses include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Collaboration, organization, and easy accessibility are the 3 primary uses.</li>
              <li>- 80% of responders use cloud storage apps primarily for work or school purposes.</li>
              <li>- All questions regarding the need of collaboration were highly scored.</li>
              <li>- Price is a pain point for all the young professionals that responded.</li>

            <h4>User Personas</h4>

                step of this momentous task was creating user stories, user flows, and a site map. Below are pictures of my final products.</p>

                for my application’s personality, I moved onto the more unique screens – whiteboard, pinboard, share screen, etc. After my foot started to fall asleep (a few hours in), I figured it was a great time to take a step back and let some
                potential users give my wireframes a shot.</p>

              <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>Luckily enough for me, I had a few friends who had nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon and were easily persuaded into being my first usability test participants! Woohoo! I walked them through my script, let them soak in my
                extraordinary wireframes, and then asked them to perform some critical tasks – <mark>sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and organize that content</mark>. Go ahead and take a peak at the <a class="case-study-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tELTxnaOqlfaPfEJIzggKeeWaxosZIHg6y_XHirwaC4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" >results</a> if you'd like.</p>
              <p>Considering they were staring at variously shaded grey boxes, my test subjects seemed to have a pretty decent grasp on the flow and functionality of StormCloud. With only a few blank stares and mis clicks made, it was clear to me
                that <mark>my wireframes were on the right track</mark>. After a quick rework of the content creation process, I was ready to go onto some branding.</p>

            <p>Here’s a quick fun fact for ya. I work as a marketer and frequently help with a quick rebranding here and there but man was I NOT ready for the indecisiveness that would ensue as I was branding my own project. I suffered through the
              sketching process and really lacked a spark of creativity during the entire exploration process. Somehow my mind got stuck on <mark>the concept of a Venn-diagram</mark> and alas! The StormCloud logo was born!</p>

            <p>After working through my mindmap, it became clear to me that my logo and my brand needed to be clean. The concept of brainstorming essentially is all about <mark>taking chaos and turning it into "the beauty after the storm"</mark>. Without simple colors and uncomplicated - yet elegant - typefaces, there would be no organized chaos fostered in this application. These were the feelings I was trying to capture when creating my style guide.</p>

          <section>
            <p>So now that you’ve read my short story on how StormCloud, it is only natural to reflect back on my process and experience to relive the joy and to learn for next time. I’d like to preface this conclusion by saying this is my first
              start to finish UX/UI project. So with that in mind, I am going to be gracious with my personal critiques. Obviously, there is PLENTY of room for improvement.</p>
            <p>Firstly, I can’t seem to say this enough to myself – <mark>do two surveys!</mark> Especially when I am looking for a focus in the original survey. I got through about half of the project and realized a second survey focused on what I envisioned
              StormCloud to look like would help narrow in my scope for the actual functionality. Opportunity missed but insight gained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I need to learn how to <mark>start on the focal piece of each screen</mark> before spending time on the less important details. For example, why in the heck did I spend time messing with the search bar on my dashboard before creating the
              actual dashboard. Might seem obvious but I tend to design the way I read – top left to bottom right. Do we as users look at design in that fashion? Of course not! I’ll learn eventually…</p>
            <p>And finally, this process is all about problem solving. I often view steps as tasks and while they kinda are, in the world of UX/UI, they are a piece of the puzzle. Better keep <mark>looking back at the big picture</mark> so I can pull it all
              together as seamlessly as possible in the.</p>
            <p>With all of this being said, I am excited to make some more mistakes soon. Onto the next project!</p>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>Today, Generation Z outpaces Millennials by 3 million. They represent 40 percent of consumers and $44B in direct buying power. This generation is wielding their mighty influence on every other generation, in every industry. This generation of digital natives is an entirely different type of consumer—one that needs a completely new type of marketing strategy to reach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>With a desire for authenticity in an enlarged and interconnected world, Generation Z is looking for word of mouth recommendations from friends, family, and social media influencers in order to feel confident when spending their money. After watching their parents work through a recession, they have become risk averse and entrepreneurial making them a great asset for small scale marketing partnerships. Clout. is a platform built to foster these partnerships through exploration, connection, and conversation.</p>

            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>Considering there was no specific niche focused on in the project brief, I relied heavily on user research and competitive analysis to see where I could make a mark. Through a quick SWOT analysis, it became clear to
              me that the <span class="highlight">corporate sector is in a constant need for the best and most optimized applications.</span> So, I dug a bit deeper to see what that would look like.</p>

            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>So get this - social media is a big deal. Generation Z and millennials spend hours on their accounts everyday searching, browsing, and engaging. Marketers have caught onto this very obvious trend and created an entirely different way to reach out to their audience - influencers. These generations seek out the influencers’ opinions and reviews in order to browse the marketplace however, if done poorly, their audience loses faith in the product as well as the influencer.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- How often they use cloud storage applications.</li>
              <li>- Which cloud storage application users use most frequently.</li>
              <li>- Their primary purpose for using these applications.</li>
              <li>- Common frustrations and favorites.</li>
              <li>- Which features were most utilized.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The survey was distributed across networking applications & online forums and concluded with <span class="highlight">25 respondents</span>. My main takeaways from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BlcQuiu39csGwCZJdpYfELNr36h7naCgK1uJrTmxY6M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="case-study-link">responses</a> include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Collaboration, organization, and easy accessibility are the 3 primary uses.</li>
              <li>- 80% of responders use cloud storage apps primarily for work or school purposes.</li>
              <li>- All questions regarding the need of collaboration were highly scored.</li>
              <li>- Price is a pain point for all the young professionals that responded.</li>

            <h4>User Personas</h4>
            <p>With these questions painting a picture, I decided to dive into the minds of some of my responders. Through this exercise, I was able to further understand their motivations, pain points, and goals.</p>

                make that a reality. First
                step of this momentous task was creating user stories, user flows, and a site map. Below are pictures of my final products.</p>

              <p>Following my little blueprint stage, I jumped feet first into the constructing phase. Wireframes and prototyping galore! First on my to-do list were the obvious screens – <span class="highlight">homepage, log in/sign up, and
                  dashboard</span>. With a general feel
                for my application’s personality, I moved onto the more unique screens – whiteboard, pinboard, share screen, etc. After my foot started to fall asleep (a few hours in), I figured it was a great time to take a step back and let some
                potential users give my wireframes a shot.</p>

              <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>Luckily enough for me, I had a few friends who had nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon and were easily persuaded into being my first usability test participants! Woohoo! I walked them through my script, let them soak in my
                extraordinary wireframes, and then asked them to perform some critical tasks – <span class="highlight">sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and organize that content</span>. Go ahead and take a peak at the <a
                  class="case-study-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tELTxnaOqlfaPfEJIzggKeeWaxosZIHg6y_XHirwaC4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">results</a> if you'd like.</p>
              <p>Considering they were staring at variously shaded grey boxes, my test subjects seemed to have a pretty decent grasp on the flow and functionality of StormCloud. With only a few blank stares and mis clicks made, it was clear to me
                that <span class="highlight">my wireframes were on the right track</span>. After a quick rework of the content creation process, I was ready to go onto some branding.</p>

            <p>Here’s a quick fun fact for ya. I work as a marketer and frequently help with a quick rebranding here and there but man was I NOT ready for the indecisiveness that would ensue as I was branding my own project. I suffered through the
              sketching process and really lacked a spark of creativity during the entire exploration process. Somehow my mind got stuck on <span class="highlight">the concept of a Venn-diagram</span> and alas! The StormCloud logo was born!</p>

            <h4>Style Guide</h4>
            <p>After working through my mindmap, it became clear to me that my logo and my brand needed to be clean. The concept of brainstorming essentially is all about <span class="highlight">taking chaos and turning it into "the beauty after the
                storm"</span>. Without simple colors and uncomplicated - yet elegant - typefaces, there would be no organized chaos fostered in this application. These were the feelings I was trying to capture when creating my style guide.</p>

                around with spacing and alignment, images, and object shaping proved to be such an odd therapeutic outlet. With an iteration ready, I sent it back to the prototyping phase to have it tested by users a bit more thoroughly.</p>

            <p>So now that you’ve read my short story on how StormCloud, it is only natural to reflect back on my process and experience to relive the joy and to learn for next time. I’d like to preface this conclusion by saying this is my first
              start to finish UX/UI project. So with that in mind, I am going to be gracious with my personal critiques. Obviously, there is PLENTY of room for improvement.</p>
            <p>Firstly, I can’t seem to say this enough to myself – <span class="highlight">do two surveys!</span> Especially when I am looking for a focus in the original survey. I got through about half of the project and realized a second survey
              focused on what I envisioned
              StormCloud to look like would help narrow in my scope for the actual functionality. Opportunity missed but insight gained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I need to learn how to <span class="highlight">start on the focal piece of each screen before spending time on the less important details</span>. For example, why in the heck did I spend time messing with the search bar on my
              dashboard before creating the
              actual dashboard. Might seem obvious but I tend to design the way I read – top left to bottom right. Do we as users look at design in that fashion? Of course not! I’ll learn eventually…</p>
            <p>And finally, this process is all about problem solving. I often view steps as tasks and while they kinda are, in the world of UX/UI, they are a piece of the puzzle. Better keep <span class="highlight">looking back at the big
                picture</span> so I can pull it all
              together as seamlessly as possible in the end.</p>
            <p>With all of this being said, I am excited to make some more mistakes soon. Onto the next project!</p>

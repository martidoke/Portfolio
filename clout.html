          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>Today, Generation Z outpaces Millennials by 3 million. They represent 40 percent of consumers and $44B in direct buying power. This generation is wielding their mighty influence on every other generation, in every industry. This generation of digital natives is an entirely different type of consumer—one that needs a completely new type of marketing strategy to reach. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>With a desire for authenticity in an enlarged and interconnected world, Generation Z is looking for word of mouth recommendations from friends, family, and social media influencers in order to feel confident when spending their money. After watching their parents work through a recession, they have become risk-averse and entrepreneurial making them a great asset for small scale marketing partnerships. Clout. is a platform built to foster these partnerships through exploration, connection, and conversation.</p>

            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>So get this - social media is a big deal. Generation Z and Millennials spend hours on their accounts every day searching, browsing, and engaging. Marketers have caught onto this very obvious trend and created an entirely different way to reach their audience - influencers. These generations seek out the influencers’ opinions and reviews to browse the marketplace; however, if done poorly, their audience loses faith in the product as well as the influencer.</p>
            <p>To create a better understanding of how social media is used by these generations, I put together a survey with three primary goals: an overview of their use(s) for social media, their view of influencers, and how they view social media marketing as a whole.</p>
            <p>Some of the major takeaways from this survey were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- 52.5% are on social media for 2-3 hours a day</li>
              <li>- 62.5% have multiple social media accounts on one platform (usually an additional 1 or 2)</li>
              <li>- Most (51.3%) have a neutral opinion about influencers/content creators and follow them based off of similar interests</li>
              <li>- Social media marketing has a bad reputation - 33.3% neutral, 30.8% dislike, 20.5% highly dislike causing 74.4% to download an ad blocker</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>So what does this all mean? </p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Social media users take in a TON of information at any given movement. Don’t believe me, watch a teenager scroll through their Instagram feed. </li>
              <li>- They also use their accounts for personal as well as professional reasons. Generation Z specifically has been said to be an entrepreneurial and innovative generation so many of them have a separate account for selling clothes, their photography, or any other side hustle they have thought of.</li>
              <li>- While influencers are a great medium for new-age digital marketing tactics, Generation Z and Millennials are looking for authenticity. When they build trust with their followers, they reap the benefits.</li>
              <li>- And finally, ad blockers are used at large preventing many social media marketing efforts to never surface to their users. This opens up an entirely different solution for all marketing efforts.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="topic">
            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>Since there plenty of influencer search engines and social media networks (both personal and professional), it was easy to decide which platforms to analyze.</p>
            <p>Upfluence is an influencer search engine that prioritizes project management over connection. They have created a platform that allows brands to narrow in on mutually beneficial partnerships and guides them to profile statistics, audience overviews, and estimated ROI. While a great asset for larger branding efforts, they lack a focus on local integration.</p>
            <p>LinkedIn, the professional social media platform, has captured the hearts of recruiters, job seekers, and the overall networker. Their application makes messaging and connections a breeze, but again, focuses on a bit larger of an audience. While it does have the capability of highlighting local opportunities, it takes a few extra steps to get to that solution.</p>
            <p>And finally - Instagram, the personal hotspot for all personal posts and interactions. This is ultimately the tool most nanoinfluencers on clout. will be using in partnerships to execute their posts. Luckily, their platform is so general that creating a complementary product is somewhat easy to create.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, all of these platforms encourage community - but usually on a global scale. They are killing it in their sector but clout. can enter a new market of recharging local business marketing.</p>

          <section>
            <h4>User Personas</h4>
            <p>For my user personas, I wanted to focus on a few key users for clout.. They included a college student looking for easy money, a young adult seeking independence financially & personally, and a Millennial marketer seeking to capture their local market a bit better. </p>
            <p>It was clear through my conversations that all of these potential users were looking for low-maintenance, mutually-beneficial partnerships. They all realized that they had a small base for impact but if they worked with the right people and advertised to the right market, they would have the ability to utilize their platform for a better outcome.</p>

              <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>From here, I reached out to a few of my survey participants and got them in front of a wireframe prototype. They performed some simple tasks including logging in, viewing their feed, and sending a message. Feedback I received from my participants was primarily all about the lack of pictures but also a note about renaming "Messages" into "Conversations". The reasoning behind this note was that it felt more professional and relationship-centered. With this all in mind, I worked a bit deeper on content and low-fidelity mockups.</p>

            <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
            <p>Clout. came into existence when a friend of mine and I were discussing the entrepreneurial spirit of Generation Z. This demographic is always coming up with their own buzzwords so I tried to find one that fit the spirit of the application. Given that clout means to have credibility among a group, it became the brand name and identity instantly.</p>

            <h4>Style Guide</h4>
            <p>Clout. is a very simple application but with bold intentions. I felt as though the color palette should emote these intentions. Neutrals were necessary but the bright green hue was chosen to be an accent color to promote activity and engagement. Given green means go and this application encourages entrepreneurship, it was a great fit. </p>
            <p>My product is a web application meaning the typography for the actual platform had to be one easily read at all font sizes. It also had to be professional and inviting, something very few fonts encourage. This led me to pick Roboto as the actual platform’s typeface. As for the logo, I felt as though a serif font would emote credibility and high status. Given Playfair Display is a very transitional typeface, I chose it to further represent the brand.</p>

              <h4>Mockups</h4>
              <p>Once the branding was complete, I revisited my low-fidelity mockups to plug-in all the typography, colors, and logo. I then proceeded to add in user photos and any addition imagery. There was a bit of altering done to alignment and content in this stage but that was to create a better storyline in my prototype.</p>

              <h4>Prototyping and Usability Testing</h4>
              <p>Now that my high-fidelity mockups were finished, I linked all my screens together, created a testing script, and met up with four users. </p>
              <p>In my usability testing phase, I had each participant complete four tasks - sign up for an account and fill in their profile settings; explore, add in criteria, & connect; send a new message to their new connection; like the first post on their feed. While the first two tasks were completed effortlessly across the board, the last two were not as easily performed.</p>
              <p>All participants stuttered when trying to send the message they just typed out so a revision of the messaging box was a necessity. There was also confusion about what separates a status update from a post so this was also something that needed to be reevaluated.</p>

              <h4>Design Revisions</h4>
              <p>The first design revision I made was to the conversation flow. Because sending a message was difficult for my users, I revisited the message input box. Instead of asking the user to click enter to send the message, now there is a send button and fewer icons for attachments, emojis, and images.</p>
              <p>The second design revision I made was to the feed screen. Two of my participants hesitated before clicking the correct post primarily because the personal status bar looked very similar to a post. When revisiting this, I decided to get rid of the input field for a status update but left the top bar. This was then moved into the right sidebar to distinguish it from the rest of the posts.</p>
              <p>I went back to my participants with these changes and all said they increased the functionality of the application for them.</p>

          <section>
            <p>Clout., from start to finish, was a fun project. I have loved reading about Generation Z lately and it thrilled me to be able to create a solution for a rising marketing problem.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, I did have a difficult time letting go throughout the process. I often found myself making inferences about the audience and the users but also found myself reaching out to survey participants to run some ideas by them. This was the number one factor keeping me on track and often looking back to my problem and proposed solution. </p>
            <p>I also had a difficult time distinguishing this application from its competitors. I studied their users, architecture, and branding. Because I spent so much time in the initial research, it took me a bit of time to focus my project into the solution it is now. In the future, I plan to have better conversations with peers of mine to sort through my ideas aloud.</p>
            <p>In the end, I am very satisfied with my finished MVP. This project quickly became a passion project of mine so I do plan on revisiting it in the future to continue feature production and idea iteration. </p>
